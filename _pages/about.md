<hr />

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://xlhu.cn/) and [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4006.htm). I am a member of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), which is directed by [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4006.htm) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I received my Bachelor’s degree at Department of Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2020. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision (CV), natural language processsing (NLP), and machine learning (ML), with the goal of developing trustworthy multimodal systems that can achieve human‐level visual understanding and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. I have explored the following areas:

<li> <b>Classical CV applications</b>: Improving the accuracy and robustness of general object detection, instance segmentation, and other tasks. </li>

<li> <b>Visual-language multimodal learning</b>: Exploring potential issues and solutions for aligning multimodal models on OOD samples. </li>

<li> <b>Diffusion models</b>: Enhancing the OOD generalization of visual models by leveraging the ability of diffusion models. </li>

<li> <b>Large language models</b>: Investigating potential security risks of large language models, establishing efficient jailbreak attacks and defense methods for large language models. </li>

<li> <b>Trustworthy machine learning</b>: Exploring frontier problems such as federated learning, adversarial ML, and ML privacy. </li>
<br>
Previously, I interned at [01.ai](https://www.01.ai/). I am currently interning at Bytedance [Seed](https://team.doubao.com/en/topseed), focusing on the development of cutting-edge multimodal and reasoning [foundation models](https://team.doubao.com/en/special/doubao_1_5_pro).


<!-- My current researches aim to build up reliable and trustworthy AI systems, hopefully bring Al closer to human-level intelligence. With this goal, I have explored topics including adversarial machine learning, representation learning, brain-inspired learning and scalable multimodality learning. I am also interested in the privacy of deep learning system. -->
